Styleguide
----------

In order to keep the code readable we try to follow the [PEP8 Style Guide] [3]

Consider checking your contribution with the [PEP8 style checker] [4]

Noteable exceptions are docstrings which sometimes would get misformated when
PEP8 is followed strictly. For docstrings we follow the [numpydoc style] [5].
