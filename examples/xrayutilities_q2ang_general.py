"""
This example shows the use of the Q2AngFit function to calculate experimental
angles which can not be calculated by the analytic functions coded in the
HXRD, NonCOP and GID experimental classes, which use a fixed geometry.

Here an arbitrary goniometer together with some restrictions can be defined and
experimental angles can be calculated for this geometry

# QConversion will set up the goniometer geometry. So the first argument
# describes the sample rotations, the second the detector rotations and the
# third the primary beam direction.
# For this consider the following coordinate system (at least this is what i
# use at ID01, feel free to use your conventions):
# x: downstream (direction of primary beam)
# y: out of the ring
# z: upwards
# these three axis form a right handed coordinate system.
# The outer most sample rotation (so the one mounted on the floor) is one which
# turns righthanded (+) around the z-direction -> z+ (at the moment this
# rotation is called 'mu' in the spec-session)
# The second sample rotation ('eta') is lefthanded (-) around y -> y-

# define experimental geometry with respect to the crystalline directions
