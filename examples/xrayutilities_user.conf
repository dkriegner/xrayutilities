# XRAYUTILITIES user configuration
# default values for some properties of xrayutilities may be set
# the syntax follows the one of the ConfigParser Python module,
# which is similar to .ini files

# if you want to use this user-specific config file you need to place it in
#    ~/.xrayutilities.conf
# or the local directory
#    ./xrayutilities.conf

# The config file with the default parameters is found in the Python installation
# path of xrayutilities. It is however not recommended to change things there,
# instead the user-specific config file

# begin of xrayutilities configuration
