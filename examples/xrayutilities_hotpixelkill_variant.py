"""
The function below is a modification of the hotpixelkill function included in
the xrayutilities_id01_functions.py file.

Instead of manually specifying the list of hot pixel they are automatically
determined from a series of dark images. The idea is as follows: If in the
average data of several dark images (no intentional x-ray radiations during
acquisition) a signal above a certain threshold remains it is expected to arise
from a hot pixel and such pixels should be removed to avoid spikes in the data.
