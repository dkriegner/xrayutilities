# definition of materials is done from its space group and its free parameters.
# Atoms in the base are specified by their Wyckoff positions and potential free
# parameters of these positions

# As example we will refine zinc-blende InP which is already predefined as
# xu.materials.InP. Zincblende consists of atoms

# elements (which contain their x-ray optical properties) are loaded from
# xrayutilities.materials.elements
In = xu.materials.elements.In
P = xu.materials.elements.P

# definition of zincblende InP:
InP = xu.materials.Crystal(
    "InP", xu.materials.SGLattice(216, 5.8687, atoms=[In, P],
                                  pos=['4a', '4c']),)

# printing of information about the defined material:
print(InP)

# A very primitive visualization of the unit cell can be performed using
InP.show_unitcell()
# for more sophisticated plotting I suggest you export a CIF file and use the
# software of your choice:
# InP.toCIF('filename.cif')

# for some purposes it might be necessary to convert the SGLattice to space
# group P1
InP_p1 = xu.materials.Crystal("InP (P1)", InP.lattice.convert_to_P1())
