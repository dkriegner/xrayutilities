"""simulation subpackage of xrayutilities.

This package provides possibilities to simulate X-ray diffraction and
reflectivity curves of thin film samples. It could be extended for more
general use in future if there is demand for that.

In addition it provides a fitting routine for reflectivity data which is based
on lmfit.
