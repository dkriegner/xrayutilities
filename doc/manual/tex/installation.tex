Installing {\tt xrutils} is a three steps process
\begin{enumerate}
\item install required C libraries and Python modules
\item build and install the {\tt xrutils} C library
\item install the Python module
\end{enumerate}
All steps are described in detail in this chapter.

\section{Required third party software}
To keep the coding effort as small as possible {\tt xrutils} depends on a 
large number of third party libraries and Python modules. 

The following C/C++ libraries are needed 
\begin{description}
\item[VTK] the Visualization Toolkit, a large C++ library for 3D data
visualization
\item[HDF5] a versatile binary data format (library is implemented in C).
Although the library is not called directly, it is needed by the pytables Python
module (see below).
\end{description}

Additionally, the following Python modules must be installed in order to make 
{\tt xrutils} work as intended
\begin{description}
\item[Numpy] a Python module providing numerical array objects
\item[VTK Python bindings] usually contained in the VTK distribution, however,
on some system the Python bindings must be installed separately 
\item[Python-Tables] a powerful Python interface to HDF5
\item[Matplotlib] a Python module for high quality 1D and 2D plotting
\item[pyvtk] reading and writing legacy VTK files
\end{description}
After installing all required packages you can continue with installing and
building the C library.

\section{Building and installing the C library}

{\tt xrutils} user the SCons build system to compile the C components of the
system. You can build the library simply by typing 
\begin{verbatim}
>scons
\end{verbatim}
in the root directory of the source distribution. After building the library can
be installed with
\begin{verbatim}
>scons install --prefix=<install path>
\end{verbatim}
The library is installed in {\tt<install path>/lib}. It is absolutely necessary
to perform this step before installing the Python module since during
installation of the C library a file {\tt config.py} is created in the top
package of the Python module containing the path to the C library. This is in so
far important that the {\tt ctypes} module used to access C library functions
uses this path to find the library. In principal this step could have been
omitted on Linux systems where environment variables can be used to tell the
system where to look for shared libraries. However, on Windows systems, for
instance, no such facility exists and therefore, relying on such mechanisms
would make the installation process highly platform dependent. 

The documentation can be build with 
\begin{verbatim}
>scons doc
\end{verbatim}
which creates this file under {\tt doc/manual/}.

Finally after installing the C library you can continue with installing the
Python module.

\section{Installing the Python package}

Installation of the Python module is done via the {\tt distutils} package
shipped with every Python distribution. Actually, two installation modes are 
supported
\begin{itemize}
 \item system wide installation in the system wide Python installation
 \item local to a single user only.
\end{itemize}

In the first case, to install {\tt xrutils} into the global Python installation
simply run
\begin{verbatim}
>python setup.py
\end{verbatim}
From the root directory of the {\tt xrutils} source distribution (this is the
directory where also the {\tt SConstruct} file resides). Since your system-wide
Python installation is setup correctly you are done with the installation.

If you want to install
{\tt xrutils} only local to a single user use
\begin{verbatim}
>python setup.py --home=<local install path>
\end{verbatim}
In this case the {\tt xrutils} package is installed under {\tt <local install
path>/lib/python}. Finally you need to make your Python installation aware of
were to look for the module. For this case append the installation directory to
your {\tt PYTHONPATH} environment variable by 
\begin{verbatim}
>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<local install path>/lib/python
\end{verbatim}
on a terminal. Or, to make this configuration persistent append this line to
your local {\tt .bashrc} file in your home directory.
