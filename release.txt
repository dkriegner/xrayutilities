This document describes the process of making a new release of xrayutilities.
this procedure is intended for use on a Unix operating system.

CHECK EVERYTHING
================

Is everything running fine? perform the tests and run the examples

  cd xrayutilities/tests
  python -m unittest discover
  cd ../..

run the examples

change the version in the doc/conf.py file and in setup.py


PACKAGING
=========

create a tarball for redistribution of xrayutilities without the use of git

  python setup.py sdist

creates a tarball in the directory dist, which contains everything needed for
the installation of xrayutilities

This tarball should be uploaded to sourceforge and PyPI.

To build a executable installer for Microsoft windows run

  python setup.py bdist_msi

on a windows machine.
If not done previously you need to build the extenstion modules using

  python setup.py build -c <compiler_name>

The compiler name can be omitted if the default is working. Using Python(x,y) you want to specify "mingw32".

UPDATE DOCUMENTATION
====================

to build the documentation perform first a fresh installation since the documentation is built from the installed version of xrayutilities (uses only system python directories?)

  python setup.py install --prefix=INSTALLPATH

first one needs to rebuild the api documentation sources

  sphinx-apidoc -f -o doc/source xrayutilities  

In the root directory of the sources execute the following to rebuild the documentation pdf

  sphinx-build -b latex doc/source doc/latex
  cd doc/latex; make && mv xrayutilities.pdf ../..; cd ../..

UPDATE WEBPAGE
==============

rebuild the html documents and upload them to the sourceforge webserver
to have the correct style the style file needs to patched

  sphinx-build -b html doc/source doc/html
  cd doc; patch -p0 < css.patch; cd .. 

to upload new web-documentation connect to the sourceforge server via:

  sftp://USERNAME@web.sourceforge.net
  /home/project-web/xrayutilities/htdocs

UPDATE PyPI PACKAGE
===================

Upload new version to the python package index by

  python setup.py sdist upload
  
On a windows machine run 

  python setup.py bdist_msi upload
