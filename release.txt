This document describes the process of making a new release of xrayutilities.
this procedure is intended for use on a Unix operating system.

CHECK EVERYTHING
================

Is everything running fine? perform the tests and run the examples

  cd xrayutilities/tests
  python -m unittest discover
  cd ../..

run the examples

change the version in the doc/source/conf.py file and in setup.py


UPDATE DOCUMENTATION
====================

to build the documentation from scratch first one needs to rebuild the API
documentation sources (which is done from the installed module, so make sure 
you have the latest version installed!)

  sphinx-apidoc -f -o doc/source xrayutilities  

In the root directory of the package execute the following to rebuild the documentation pdf

  python setup.py build build_doc -b pdf
  cd build/sphinx/pdf; mv xrayutilities.pdf ../../..; cd ../../..

PACKAGING
=========

create a tarball for redistribution of xrayutilities without the use of git

  python setup.py sdist

creates a tarball in the directory dist, which contains everything needed for
the installation of xrayutilities

This tarball should be uploaded to sourceforge and PyPI.

To build a executable installer for Microsoft windows run

  python setup.py bdist_wininst

on a windows machine.
If not done previously you need to build the extenstion modules using

  python setup.py build -c <compiler_name>

The compiler name can be omitted if the default is working. 
Using Python(x,y) you want to specify "mingw32".

To build for 64-bit Windows, a known way to do it was reported by RG is 
using MS Visual Studio Express 2008 (which is freely available for download). 
To perform the installation or build a installer package perform the 
following steps:
 * open an administrator shell
 * execute: 'set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1'
 * execute: 'setenv /x64 /release' (use /x86 for a 32-bit build)
 * compile with: 'python setup.py build -c msvc' which should give you
   the chance to run 'python setup.py bdist_wininst' or install.

See https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/64BitCythonExtensionsOnWindows
for details.

UPDATE WEBPAGE
==============

rebuild the html documents and upload them to the sourceforge webserver
to have the correct style the style file needs to patched

  python setup.py build_doc -b html
  cp doc/css.patch build/sphinx/; cd build/sphinx; patch -p0 < css.patch; cd ../.. 

to upload new web-documentation connect to the sourceforge server via:

  sftp://USERNAME@web.sourceforge.net
  /home/project-web/xrayutilities/htdocs
  
files on sourceforge can be moved/archived using

sftp://USERNAME@frs.sourceforge.net/home/frs/project/x/xr/xrayutilities

UPDATE PyPI PACKAGE
===================

Upload new version to the python package index by

  python setup.py sdist upload
  
On a windows machine run 

  python setup.py bdist_wininst upload
